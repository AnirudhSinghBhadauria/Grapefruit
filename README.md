# Grapefruit üçä

Grapefruit is a monorepo that combines TypeScript, Zod, Drizzle, PostgreSQL, Next.js, Express.js, and Docker to provide a solid foundation for building scalable, maintainable, and efficient web applications. The "trpc" branch also incorporates tRPC for end-to-end typesafe APIs. Additionally, Grapefruit uses PNPM workspaces for efficient package management.
